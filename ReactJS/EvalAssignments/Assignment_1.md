# Assignment: Component Communication Challenge

## Tasks:

**Task 1: Multi-Level Component Architecture**
Create a product catalog where data flows through at least 3 levels of components. Design the prop structure so that the deepest component can influence what's displayed at the top level.

**Task 2: Dynamic JSX Rendering**
Build components that render completely different JSX structures based on the props they receive. The same component should be able to display content in multiple formats without code duplication.

**Task 3: Props Validation Logic**
Implement a system where child components must validate and transform the props they receive before using them. Handle scenarios where props might be missing, incorrect type, or need preprocessing.

**Task 4: Component Reusability Test**
Design one component that can be reused in at least 4 different ways within your application by only changing the props passed to it. Demonstrate this reusability in your implementation.

Below is the **exact learning plan + best YouTube playlists + hands-on resources** tailored to your uploaded file **ReactJS-Master-Class.md**  and your 1-week deadline with 3 mini-projects + 1 major project using WebAPI (CORS, Axios, Fetch).

This follows the structure and concepts in the file **exactly**, while optimizing for fast but solid learning.

---

# **1. Your Required Learning (from the file + your project needs)**

From the uploaded masterclass file, you need to learn:

### **Core React Basics**

* JSX
* Components
* Props
* State (`useState`)
* Events
* Lists + `map()`
* Keys
* Conditional Rendering

### **Intermediate Essentials**

* Hooks:

  * `useEffect` (fetch API, lifecycle)
  * `useRef` (DOM refs)

### **Data Fetching**

* Fetch API (already explained in file)
* Axios (must learn additionally)
* Handling loading, error states
* CORS basics (for integrating WebAPI)

### **Project Setup**

* Create React App (CRA) or Vite
* Folder structure
* Reusable components

### **Your 3 Mini-Projects (from file)**

1. Todo App
2. Toggle Button + API Fetch
3. Color Changer App

### **Major Project Needs**

* Integrate your ASP.NET WebAPI
* Learn:

  * CORS policy
  * Axios CRUD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * Error handling
  * Displaying data using state + effects
  * Forms + controlled inputs

---

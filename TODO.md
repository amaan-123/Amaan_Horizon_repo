# 🌐 Full-Stack Developer Learning Tracker

Markdown tracker with interactive checkboxes for revision and to-do items, and **three simple understanding level tags**.

- Avoid theory overload: limit new info per session to prevent cognitive overload.  
- Follow the experiential cycle: do → observe results → decide what to change → experiment again.  
- Balance learning: pair every theory chunk with immediate practice.  
- Slow down to speed up: prioritize gradual learning so skills become habits.  
- Automate habits: practice until skills use fewer cognitive resources before adding new theory.  
- Use the 5:1 rule: aim for ~5 hours practice per 1 hour theory; adjust by how fast you form habits.

## Immediate TO-DO's

- Python
  - Less
    - Implement other sorting algos instead of bubble sort in Exercise-1
- JS playlist: Chai
  - 25:21 of 35th - Projects

- HTML - see list below
- CSS - see list below
<!-- - Read GPT's research articles
- All-in-one concepts js/html/css side proj on novel/worthy concept
  - implement learnings like:
    - 26min of vid 33, 10min of vid 34 ChaiAurCode
    -
- Generative AI for everyone
  - vector databases or retrieval-augmented generation
- Where in the path is a good place to learn about web development security practices/application security?: research!
- Postman playlist & docs: scripts, testing & visualiser
